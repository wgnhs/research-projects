For example, depth-to-bedrock information of the area underlain by dolostone bedrock units helps identify those places that are most susceptible to groundwater contamination from land application of nutrients and pesticides.",

Seepage lakes have no surface water inlets or outlets, and therefore can be sensitive to changes in the water table from droughts or extreme precipitation events. The goal of this project is to investigate the geologic conditions driving water fluctuations to better understand and manage future lake levels. To that end, we will install piezometers and measure water levels over several years, as well as develop a water budget for the lake. A better understanding of the Drummond area lakes will contribute to the body of knowledge about the groundwater/surface water resource and geological resource in northern Wisconsin and is part of the larger on-going effort focusing on characterizing aquatic, groundwater, and geological resources of the State of Wisconsin. This understanding will be of benefit to all landowners and stakeholders.",
